### 08. Remote State

#### What is Remote State and State Locking?

**Overview:**
Terraform uses state to map real-world resources to your configuration, track metadata, 
and improve performance for large infrastructures. By default, Terraform stores state locally, 
but for team-based environments, it's crucial to use remote state storage to share the state across team members.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Remote State:**
   - Storage of the Terraform state file in a remote location.
   - Facilitates collaboration by allowing team members to work on the same infrastructure without conflicts.

2. **State Locking:**
   - Mechanism to prevent concurrent state modifications.
   - Ensures only one user can modify the state at a time.
   - Prevents race conditions and data corruption.

**Benefits of Remote State:**
- Centralized state management.
- Enhanced collaboration.
- Improved security and versioning.

#### Remote Backends with S3

**Overview:**
Terraform supports various remote backends to store state files, including AWS S3. Using S3 as a backend ensures centralized, secure, and versioned state management.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **S3 Backend Configuration:**
   - Specifies the S3 bucket, key, and region.
   - Can integrate with DynamoDB for state locking.

2. **DynamoDB Table:**
   - Used for state locking to ensure only one operation can modify the state at a time.

**Example Configuration:**

**File: `main.tf`**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# S3 Backend Configuration
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-remote-state-bucket"
    key            = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "terraform-remote-state-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "Terraform Remote State Bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-lock-table"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "Terraform Lock Table"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

**Steps to Execute:**
1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Create an Execution Plan:**
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

5. **Verify the Remote State:**
   - Check the S3 bucket to see the state file.
   - Check the DynamoDB table for lock entries.

#### Terraform State Commands

**Overview:**
Terraform provides several commands to interact with the state file, enabling you to inspect, modify, and manage state directly.

**Key Commands:**

1. **terraform state list:**
   - Lists all resources in the state file.
   - Usage: `terraform state list`

2. **terraform state show:**
   - Displays detailed information about a specific resource in the state file.
   - Usage: `terraform state show [resource]`

3. **terraform state mv:**
   - Moves resources in the state file.
   - Usage: `terraform state mv [source] [destination]`

4. **terraform state rm:**
   - Removes resources from the state file.
   - Usage: `terraform state rm [resource]`

**Example Commands:**

```sh
# List all resources in the state
terraform state list

# Show details of a specific resource
terraform state show aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state

# Move a resource
terraform state mv aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state aws_s3_bucket.new_state

# Remove a resource
terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.new_state
```

#### Terraform Provisioners

**Overview:**
Provisioners in Terraform allow you to execute scripts or commands on a local or remote machine as part of the resource creation or destruction process.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Types of Provisioners:**
   - **Local-exec:** Executes commands on the machine running Terraform.
   - **Remote-exec:** Executes commands on a remote resource (e.g., EC2 instance).

2. **Provisioner Configuration:**
   - Included in the resource block.
   - Can be conditional based on resource creation or destruction.

**Example Configuration:**

**File: `main.tf`**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Instance ${self.id} created"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
    ]

    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
      host        = self.public_ip
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Example Instance"
  }
}
```

**Steps to Execute:**
1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Create an Execution Plan:**
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

5. **Verify the Provisioners:**
   - Check the console output for local-exec command.
   - SSH into the instance and verify Nginx installation.

#### Introduction to AWS EC2

**Overview:**
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud, enabling you to launch virtual servers (instances) as needed.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Instances:**
   - Virtual servers in the cloud.
   - Types include general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and storage-optimized.

2. **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
   - Template used to create an instance, including OS and application data.

3. **Instance Types:**
   - Defines the hardware capabilities (CPU, memory, storage).

4. **Security Groups:**
   - Virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.

#### Demo: Deploying an EC2 Instance

**Steps:**
1. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Go to the EC2 console.
   - Click "Launch Instance".
   - Select an AMI (e.g., Ubuntu).
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro).
   - Configure instance details.
   - Add storage.
   - Add tags.
   - Configure security group.
   - Review and launch.

2. **Connect to the Instance:**
   - Use SSH to connect to the instance.
   - Verify the instance is running.

#### AWS EC2 with Terraform

**Overview:**
Terraform can manage EC2 instances, security groups, and other related resources.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **aws_instance:**
   - Manages an EC2 instance.

2. **aws_security_group:**
   - Manages a security group.

**Example Configuration:**

**File: `main.tf`**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Example Instance"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "terraform-example-sg"
  description = "Security group for example instance"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-123456"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Example SG"
  }
}
```

**Steps to Execute:**
1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Create an Execution Plan:**
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

5. **Verify the Created Resources:**
   - Check the EC2 console to see the instance and security group.
